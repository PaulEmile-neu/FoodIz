# The project (FoodIz)

During a few course at ISEN we had to develop an android application based on the Kotlin language.
This application was a food Order application in which a customer could access some menu and order them thanks to an API.

This application is composed of these different technologies :

    - Volley (to mannage API Call)
    - PaperDb and SharedPreference (as storage mannager)
    - Activities
    - API and webService
    - Kotlin
    - RecyclerView



## Design

I worked a lot on the design of the application to provide a nice application to final user and to work on my front skills on android 

## Feature

FoodIz contain a lot of features
    The user can access different menus, he can check it's shopping cart and update it dynamically. He can also view it's last order in the profile section. 

    The user can signUp on the app before sending the final order
    The user can login and remain login in the app until he logout
    The user can easily navigate in the application to order it's meal or access different activities

    The application was made to be the most intuitive and easy to use for the user

## Project conclusion

this project and these courses allowed me to discover concepts in android that I did not master before. I also understood the needs of companies and the working method to adopt to satisfy them.
